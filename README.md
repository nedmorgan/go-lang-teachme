# Teach Myself Golang

### Why did I choose Golang?
I heard of Go from a frind who uses it in a professional setting and I was curious as to its functionality. I'm hoping to explore some of its benefits and hopefully be able to build upon what I learn today and create some meaningful applications.

### What problems does Go solve?
With Go you're able to create very lightweight applications that only import exactly the packages you want to use and create an application that specifically executes a certain contained function.

### Who created Golang?
Golang was created by Google. This language is used by many other companies and used in a wide variety of applications like Docker and Kubernetes. Golang is a server side language and was created to utilize the processing power of new multi-core processors.

### Accessing Golang
In order to use Go you first need to download it to your machine. Once it is downloaded it has a predetermined path where is executes Go on your system of ```$HOME/go```. In this folder you are able to write in Go and have Go code executed. You can change the path of this by editing your bash profile or zsh profile.

If you want to execute Go and you change the syntax you need to run ```go build``` in your project folder. Once that is executed then you'll be able to run the file in the terminal. Go will create a new file that you can call. For example I have a file called ```hello.go```, after running ```go build``` I will have a file call ```hello```. In order to run that file, in the terminal I will need to call ```./hello``` in the terminal and the code will execute.

### Using Golang
Golang is mainly used in the terminal through server-side rendering. Once Goland is built it can be executed in ther terminal, similar to executing code with node.js.
